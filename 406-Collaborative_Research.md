## 406. Developing and Sustaining Collaborative Research in the Humanities

Friday, 8 January, 5:15–6:30 p.m., 304, JW Marriott  

A special session  

Presiding: Brian Rosenblum, Univ. of Kansas Libraries  

Panelists share examples of four collaborative projects involving research by a team of two or more scholars from literary studies and computer science or other disciplines. Discussion focuses on best practices, lessons learned, communication strategies, what challenges to anticipate, and methods, tools, and outcomes.

**Projects & Speakers:**

Speakers:
Sayan Bhattacharyya, Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Katharine Coles, University of Utah
Patricia Fumerton, University of California, Santa Barbara
Lauren Klein, Georgia Institute of Technology
Nina McCurdy, University of Utah
Muhammad Saad Shamin, Baylor College of Medicine
Carl Stahmer, University of California, Davis

**TOME: http://dhlab.lmc.gatech.edu/tome/**
Short for Interactive TOpic Model and MEtadata Visualization, TOME is a tool designed to support the exploratory thematic analysis of digitized archival collections. Collaboratively authored by a computer scientist and a literary scholar, it generates visualizations designed to allow scholars to trace the evolution and circulation of themes across social networks and over time. Resting on an archive of nineteenth-century abolitionist newspapers, the PIs are able to employ their tool to ask questions about authorship, influence, and audience. The PI's collaboratively conceived of the computational technique of topic modeling as a process of thematic exploration. Their work was motivated by the implications of their successes and failures for the fields of both nineteenth-century scholarship and text visualization. (Panelist: Laren Klein.)

**Poemage: http://www.sci.utah.edu/~nmccurdy/Poemage/**
A collaboration between poets, literary scholars and computer scientists specializing in visualization and simulation, the Poemage project aims to develop a tool to visualize the "poem space" of a poem—not only the shape of the poem on the page and its internal actions and relationships, but also how the poem sounds, as well as its engagements with the reader. The collaborative process forced the project teams to rethink how they understood poetry, determine what data was valuable to each group, consider how to balance long-term and short-term goals, and imagine how the project might generate new insights in both literary studies and computer science. (Panelists: Katharine Coles & Nina McCurdy.)

**EBBA: http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/**
The English Broadside Ballad Archive brings together a team of experts in the fields of English literature, digital programming, and ethnographic music, to make broadside ballads of the seventeenth century fully accessible as texts, art, music, and cultural records. The project is intensely collaborative, and advances through a process of constantly meeting, arguing, and group thinking. Team leaders from every key aspect of the project meet weekly to address problems as a team—where everyone is confident that they can speak freely and that their ideas will be heard and often implemented, even at the cost of redoing aspects of the project—and the team leaders mentor or apprentice students and those newer to the project in an ongoing regenerative chain-of-being (working both up and down) of collaborative expertise. (Panelists: Patricia Fumerton and Carl G. Stahmer.)

**HathiTrust+Bookworm: https://htrcbookworm.wordpress.com/**
The HT+BW project is a large-scale, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional endeavor involving collaborators from the fields of literature, librarianship, education, culturomics, computer science, and applied mathematics. It combines an interest in humanistic research based on texts and their interpretation with the possibility of scientific and statistical analyses of corpora. This presentation will discuss the dynamics of this collaboration, including the emphasis on finding shared values to move the collaboration forward. (Panelists: Sayan Bhattacharyya and Muhammad Saad Shamim.)

**Speakers:**

Katharine Coles (co­PI) is a professor at the University of Utah. She served from 2006 to 2012 as Utah Poet Laureate and in 2009 and 2010 as the inaugural director of the Poetry Foundation’s Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute. She has received grants and awards from the NEA, the NEH and the Guggenheim Foundation. Katharine Coles’ fifth poetry collection, The Earth Is Not Flat (Red Hen 2013), was written under the auspices of the National Science Foundation’s Antarctic Artists and Writers Program. Her sixth collection, Flight, is due out in 2016.

Nina McCurdy is a computer science PhD student at the University of Utah, studying Graphics and Scientific Visualization, as well as a graduate research assistant at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute.

EBBA
Patricia Fumerton (Director) is Professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Director of UCSB’s award­wining, NEH­funded English Broadside Ballad Archive (EBBA), http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu. She has published many articles on the collaborative and thus necessarily protean process of creating a successful digital archive, and is currently working (along with Dr. Carl Stahmer and Professor Andrew Griffin) on a multi­media digital co­edited publication, Making a Broadside Ballad (EMC Imprint) and a new book, Moving Media, Tactical Publics: English Broadside Ballads in the Early Modern Period. She is editor of Broadside Ballads from the Pepys Collection: A Selection of Texts,
 
Approaches, and Recordings (Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 2013) as well as co­editor of Ballads and Broadsides in Britain, 1500­1800 (Ashgate, 2010).

Carl G. Stahmer (Associate Director) is the Director of Digital Scholarship at the University Library, University of California, Davis, in which capacity he oversees a variety of digital initiatives on campus. Stahmer has been working in the field of digital humanities since the mid 1990s, when he began constructing the Romantic Circles website (http://www.rc.umd.edu), named then by the National Endowment for the Humanities as one of the top twenty educational websites in the world. Stahmer has worked as a computer programmer and system architect for a variety of governmental, academic, and commercial technology initiatives over the past twenty years. He has served as the Associate Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology and the Humanities at the University of Maryland (MITH), as a member of the Advisory Board of the Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth­Century Studies (NINES). Stahmer’s current research is focused on the development of an open source, content based search and retrieval (image recognition) platform for digital archives of historical printed materials.

TOME
Lauren Klein (co­PI) is an assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech, where she also directs the Digital Humanities Lab. Her writing has appeared in American Literature, Early American Literature, and American Quarterly. She has received research fellowships from the American Antiquarian Society, the Library Company of Philadelphia, and the New York Public Library. With Matthew K. Gold, she edits the Debates in the Digital Humanities book series (University of Minnesota Press). In addition, she serves as PI on the NEH Office of Digital Humanities­funded TOME project, a tool to support the interactive exploration of text­based archives. Lauren is currently at work on two book projects: the first about food and eating in relation to the early American archive, and the second that provides a cultural history of data visualization from the eighteenth century to the present day.

HATHI­BOOKWORM
Sayan Bhattacharyya is currently a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois, Urbana­ Champaign. He received a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, writing a dissertation focused on the theatrical work of the Trinidad­born writer C.L.R. James and the Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore. At the 2015 annual conference of the MLA, he co­organized a special session titled ‘Humanistic inquiry with large corpora of digitized text and metadata: Towards new epistemologies?’ His recent publications include the article 'A Fragmentizing Interface to a Large Corpus of Digitized Text' (co­authored with Peter Organisciak and J. Stephen Downie) in the March 2015 special issue on ‘The Future of Reading’ of the peer­reviewed journal Interdisciplinary Science Reviews. For the HT+BW project, Sayan co­developed the data management plan and leads education and instructional efforts aimed at the broadest possible audience.
